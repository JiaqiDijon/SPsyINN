You can easily follow this step to complete the testing process.

## Notes

Please ensure that you extract the zip files in the following directories to their respective locations:

- `Data/Duolingo`
- `Data/MaiMemo`

(Additionally, there is no need to preprocess the data further, as the provided data has already been standardized and is ready for use.)

This is due to network restrictions that prevented us from uploading these files to GitHub. We apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your understanding.
